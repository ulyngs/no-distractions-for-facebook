<p>I (Ulrik Lyngs) built 'Newsfeed toggle for Facebook' as a Safari App Extension which does only this: hide the newsfeed, chat sidebar, and other distracting content on the front page of Facebook. These can be toggled on by clicking the extension icon.</p>

<p>The extension collects zero data.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or suggestions, contact me at ulrik.lyngs@gmail.com.</p>
