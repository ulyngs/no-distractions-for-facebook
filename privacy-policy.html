<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>I (Ulrik Lyngs) built '"No Distractions" for Facebook' as a Safari App Extension which does only this: allow the use to hide the newsfeed, chat sidebar, and other distracting content on the front page of Facebook, and save their prefered settings.</p>

<p>The extension collects zero data.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or suggestions, contact me at ulrik.lyngs@gmail.com.</p>
